## Description
READMEnot is a powerful tool designed to automate the creation of README files for code repositories. By leveraging OpenAI's GPT-4 model, it intelligently identifies and extracts relevant information from the project's files to generate comprehensive and well-structured README sections. This tool simplifies the documentation process, ensuring that essential details about the project title, description, installation, usage, and configuration are accurately captured and formatted.
